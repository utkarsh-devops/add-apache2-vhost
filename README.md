# add-apache2-vhost v0.2
Short and easy to use PHP script that automatically creates Apache2 virtual host for Linux  

**Usage:**  
1) Create a new folder that would be a root folder of your new host  
2) Place script into the folder  
3) Start a built-in php server in this folder: php -S 127.0.0.1:8000  
4) Run script from any browser (localhost:8000/add.php)  

Script will ask you to input only two things: **ip address** for your host and **root password** to edit necessary config files.  
That's it!  
Any feedback would be appreciated!
